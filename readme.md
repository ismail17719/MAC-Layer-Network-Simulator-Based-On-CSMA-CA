This is a a CSMA/CA simulator written in Python based on simulator of the same type found the link https://github.com/StevenSLXie/CSMA-Simulator with little bit variations. One such that is mentionable here is the backoff strategy. Instead of using exponential backoff procedure, a new backoff procedure based on fibonacci series has been added. There are also changes and variables added for data required for measuring network throughput. To run the simulation you need to run the main.py. In order to observe MAC layer events during simulation please set DEBUG = True in perform.py
